				<p>Ute Ploier wants to develop fashion further by breaking clichés, playing with them and scrutinising them, and then to surprise with the answer, which is: the question about the issue is always the first step that demands particular colours, forms and its own haptic, similar to a logical development that arises out of the question.</p>

				<p>“First there is the issue, out of which a concept is to be developed that determines both the materials and the forms. The issues can be political, aim to develop a mood or to pose gender or social questions, which may well be interlinked.” The designer and university professor Ute Ploier finds confirmation for this in the students, whose varying attitudes form the questions to be answered during the course. For the students it means finding out the personal statement and seeing what is meant by it, in order to make an individual approach possible for Ploier. “An absolute individualist sees themselves rather in the artistic field and gets different feedback from me than someone who wants to work commercially, develop their own label or work in a fashion house. It must be clear that fashion is an extremely hard and competitive business that requires the necessary individual initiative – nobody is waiting for you when you leave university, you have to raise your own voice and make yourself noticed.”</p>

And here the men were no less ostentatious in displaying their physical attraction, between the 15th and 18th centuries even more ostentatious than women. Men were the beautiful sex.”</p>
