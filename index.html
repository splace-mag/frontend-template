				<p class="extra">Ute Ploier wants to develop fashion further by breaking clichés, playing with them and scrutinising them, and then to surprise with the answer, which is: the question about the issue is always the first step that demands particular colours, forms and its own haptic, similar to a logical development that arises out of the question.</p>

				<p>“First there is the issue, out of which a concept is to be developed that determines both the materials and the forms. The issues can be political, aim to develop a mood or to pose gender or social questions, which may well be interlinked.” The designer and university professor Ute Ploier finds confirmation for this in the students, whose varying attitudes form the questions to be answered during the course. For the students it means finding out the personal statement and seeing what is meant by it, in order to make an individual approach possible for Ploier. “An absolute individualist sees themselves rather in the artistic field and gets different feedback from me than someone who wants to work commercially, develop their own label or work in a fashion house. It must be clear that fashion is an extremely hard and competitive business that requires the necessary individual initiative – nobody is waiting for you when you leave university, you have to raise your own voice and make yourself noticed.”</p>

				<p>During her course (Ploier worked almost exclusively with male professors who designed fashion for women) she questioned the gender relationships, she satirised or turned things round in order ultimately as a woman to design men’s fashion. “If you look at and compare how many women and how many men manage fashion houses and how many women and men study fashion there is a great discrepancy.” At the beginning there were few women who did men’s fashion. What does it mean not to design for your own gender? “I was able to assume a greater distance to what I design and I noticed that I felt much happier and found it exciting to quickly come up against the boundaries that can easily be shifted in the narrow framework of men’s fashion. Today this is easier than it was ten years ago. Then there were far fewer possibilities to use materials, cuts and colours.”</p>

				<p>Ute Ploier explains men’s preference for rather darker colours, such as black, blue and grey, through the fact that they perceive colours differently from women. Ludwig Wittgenstein regarded it as meaningless to talk about the character of colours. It depended only on the wearer of the colour and with colours one actually only thinks about special uses. “You can play with the psychological interplay between the colours you wear and what you radiate, and the interaction that results from it,” says Ploier, because: “feelings or a dynamic can be expressed through fashion. You therefore always have to see colours in the context or in the respective project, not separated as an individual aspect and without attribution according to colour criteria.” The extent to which colour determines form and what happens, when colour assumes form, results from the interplay as well as the juxtaposition of colour and form. It is is always colour that is predominant. “Colours naturally have a particular effect on people and trigger particular feelings. In my fashion, however, it is very much concerned with the breaking and shifting of perspectives, about re-assignments. Then it is exciting to attribute a colour to a form that you don’t exactly expect. This results in the shifting.”</p>

				<p>Is “optical intelligence”, that is the  ability to recognise colours correctly, to select the right nuances for particular aims and situations, inherent or can it be learned in the fashion course at the Linz University of Art? Ploier: “I certainly think that some people have more of a propensity to designing and colours than others do. The concern with colour is quite clearly part of the education, if it is a question of unlearning ways of seeing in order to develop them afresh. Last year a student worked on the theme of sound colours. She dismantled music into the individual tones, ascribed colours to them and in this way created a system of colour combinations which she herself would never have made use of. The self-imposed diktat helped her to shift her own ways of seeing.”</p>

				<p>The history of the “Ute Ploier” label is also a very subtle liberalisation strategy around the breaking up of rigid images with the view of particular details using the humour and irony of a designer who tells a credible story. There is a protagonist for each collection, like a leading actor in a film. The “Lost Angeles” collection, for example, was inspired by Gottfried Helnwein, for whom our western world, with all its tendencies and wounds can best be experienced in Los Angeles (“The city is like an open wound. I get the impression that this is the place where you can see the state of western culture most clearly, better than anywhere else. For some reason nobody here is even trying to control the chaos or conceal anything about the current situation.”) The collection itself moves in the world of colour as Ploier imagines Los Angeles (she has never been there) – colours like those of Steven Meisel, blue swimming pools and gleaming sunlight. Nevertheless, the collection is irritating: if you look at the suits more closely, it is evident that their seams have not been sewn together but are held by elastic strips underneath them. “Customers buy a piece of clothing because they want participate in the world or the universe that  is associated with a brand or a collection. So it is very difficult for a label without a history.”</p>

				<p>Apart from which, if you are designing for someone else, regardless of whether it is a man or a woman, this always has something to do with a position of power, says Ploier: “I suggest something and dress someone in one of my ideas; that is more than a piece of clothing – you read the cut, the colour the material.” All these factors say something or want to say something about the wearer; here quite clearly an idea of power resonates or, as in Ploier’s case, a statement: “For me it is a case of shifting classical male images. In our culture the suit is a status symbol. I am interested in what happens when I use particular materials that are not normally suitable for it – when I line it with down it becomes as soft as a pillow. This is not conceived of as a power-game with men, but as assistance in order to free them from role models.” For Ute Ploier fashion becomes relevant when tradition can be broken, things shifted and the horizon expanded. Her concerns are socio-political. The new course is called Fashion, Design and Technology, that is, fashion with a technological focus. For Ploier this means above all combining the latest technology with the old: “In Austria there are still two blueprint printers, at the same time clothing can be produced using 3-D printing technology. For me it is a question of the students dealing with the whole spectrum and developing their own standpoint, an attitude to the subject of fashion and technology, where fashion and technology merge, and not attaching technology to fashion like a gadget.” </p>

				<p>For Ploier things are similar with colour: “At material fairs there is one colour catalogue or one spectrum per season. Fashion followers note and photograph the Pantone numbers from these colour walls and follow them slavishly. I go to the fair without a colour concept and look at what colours there are. My collection is without colour or form, I just have a tendency, a feeling or an atmosphere in my head. For me it is impossible to design without materials. Fashion is also a question of equilibrium; you can’t translate every form into every material. I can only design when I have the materials in their colours to hand.”</p>

				<p>If one asks the designer her favourite colour she answers: “I seldom work with white, if at all then with broken white in which other colours such as stone hues, grey or blue-white, natural white mix in. Never with pure white, because it is difficult to display other colours. Black and white automatically makes a graphic pattern. Here there is already a clear mixing and no white part any more.”</p>

				<p>In addition she asks: “What white tone are we talking about? Each has a particular vibration or timbre. It depends on the context in which white is placed, because then it can be a complete colour or a colour that leaves a great deal open, or a starting point, and so the opposite of perfection.”</p>
